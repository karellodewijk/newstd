A c++ 11 standard library implementation

The aim is a straight forward, clean and standard compliant implementation of the c++ 11 standard library. 

Focus is on a sufficiently high level of programming with high readability without being stupid and see where it can land performance wise. And maybe at a later stage work from there.
